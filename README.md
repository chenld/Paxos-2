Paxos
=====

1) Implement Paxos in Java.   2) Rigorously test Paxos.  Ideas borrowed from the model checker paper (http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/god/verisoft/popl97.ps).  If a test fails, the system gives a trace of all calls to the channel (in order) along with parameters and return values and why it was a failure.
